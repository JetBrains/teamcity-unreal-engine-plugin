# plugin-sdk-core

`plugin-sdk-core` is a shared module providing core functionality for multiple plugins.
It was originally designed as a common foundation for plugins built on top of existing TeamCity Open API packages.

## Future Direction

Currently, it's bundled with the UE plugin, but the original plan was to make it a separate library.
Whether or not that will happen is up in the air.
